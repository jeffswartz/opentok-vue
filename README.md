# opentok-vue
OpenTok component for Vue.js.

## Example

The example directory contains a sample app. To run the sample:

1. Save a copy of the config.sample.js, and name the copy config.js.

2. Edit the following values in the config.js file:

   * `OT_API_KEY`: Your OpenTok API key
   * `OT_API_SECRET`: Your OpenTok API secret
   * `OT_SESSION_ID`: An OpenTok session ID

  You can obtain an API key and secret for one of your OpenTok projects,
  along with a test session ID for that project, at the
  [OpenTok account page](https://tokbox.com/account/#).

3. Run the following:

   ```sh
   cd ./example
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

The sample app runs at http://localhost:8080/.
